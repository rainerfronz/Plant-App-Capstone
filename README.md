https://github.com/rainerfronz/Streaming-Search.git

This is my Thnkful submission for my first Capstone. The app I created helps users search for streaming services for movies and shows. It also provides a quick summary, rating and image for the primary show. I used 2 Api to crete this App. Utelly and Imdb.
Features:
Find Straming Service for searched Film or Televisoin Show.
See Image from Movie or show as well as Plot Summery, Imdb rating and genres.


For this app  I used the following technologies, CSS, fetch, jquery, HTZML,
and Java Script.
